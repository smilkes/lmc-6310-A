Resources for LMC-6310-A lab

## Professor:
Anne Sullivan

## T.A.:
Sara Milkes Espinosa

## Description
Welcome to this repo! You will find ressources for the 6310-A Labs here. The labs are meant to give you time to work on your own projects for the class, ask questions and get additional resources. During the labs, we will go over basics about the technologies needed for each project, we will do some in class exercises and go through resources for you to get started. However, remember that you will need to go over many of these resources in your own time! 

The repo is orgnized with the same structure of the class. Feel free to clone to follow the exercises and examples.

## Important Resources
It may be daunting to navigate through all the possible resources online, especially with many Twine versions. I have compiled a set of relevant tutorials and materials that I highly encourage you to look at in the *repository's wiki*.
